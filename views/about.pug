					p Hi! I'm an experienced Software Engineer with 8+ years in the software industry, currently working as a Senior Front-End Developer at KnowBe4.
					p I specialize in creating user-centric designs with accessibility as a top priority. At KnowBe4, I develop training modules and localized content using their proprietary Bob the Builder platform, always ensuring responsive designs and accessibility standards are met while collaborating with cross-functional teams including product managers, instructional designers, and QA engineers.
					p My journey began in audio engineering at Belmont University, which taught me attention to detail and technical precision. I then transitioned into graphic design and print media at Immortal Printing, where I honed my visual design skills using Adobe Creative Suite. This creative foundation led me to pursue a Master's in Computer Science at MTSU, bridging my design background with technical expertise.
					p This unique path from audio engineering to graphic design to software development gives me a distinctive perspective on both visual aesthetics and technical implementation. Through my portfolio projects, you can see my evolution as a fullstack developer with a strong emphasis on frontend technologies, and my commitment to creating interactive, accessible web experiences that prioritize user needs.
